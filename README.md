## 📈 Results
**TBD**  
*| Metric | Value |  
|---------|--------|  
| Training Accuracy | 92.1% |  
| Test Accuracy | 91.4% |*  
  
*Optional:  
Loss and accuracy curves in `/results/`  
Example predictions visualized*

## 🚀 How to Run
**TBD**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/v0lia/fashion-mnist-classifier.git  
cd fashion-mnist-classifier  
pip install -r requirements.txt
